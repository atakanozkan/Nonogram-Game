This is my game project that I completed while I was interning in Libra Softworks.

Nonogram
Nonogram is a logic problem with straightforward rules and difficult solutions. 

Rules
There is a grid of squares that must either be filled in with black paint or indicated with an X. The lengths of the runs of black squares in each row are recorded next to each row in the grid. The lengths of the runs of black squares in each column are given above that column. Finding every black square is your goal. 
Blacken a square by left-clicking on it. Right-click to annotate with an X. Mark several squares by clicking and dragging.
